      <description>Happy school year! With a lot of of help from Rselenium, I did some Wikipedia scrapping and gathered a data set on Lithuanian schools. The data set does not cover all existing schools, but it gives a rough overview of the situation. According to the ministry of education where were 1151 schools in 2016-2017, so the data set covers roughly about 80\(\%\) of the total population.
One can see three major peak periods: education reform (1777-1781), first independence (1918-1919), second independence(1991-1993).</description>

      <description>Package rSymPy offers a nice possibility to do symbolic computation in R. In this post I want to suggest an alternative to it, which helped me out to derive some complex expressions of conditional moments for multivariate normal distribution. rSymPy was simply too slow for my tasks, so I remembered computer algebra system - Maxima. What is also nice, that this option also produces Tex output. In this post I will provide some instructions for Windows users.</description>
