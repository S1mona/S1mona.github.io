Happy school year! With a lot of of help from Rselenium I did some Wikipedia scrapping and gathered a data set on Lithuanian schools. According to [the ministry of education](http://www.svis.smm.lt/) where were 1151 schools in 2016-2017. Data set covers about 80$\%$ of the total population. In this post only information that can be found on Wikipedia and schools websites which are given is presented.
One can see three major peak periods: education reform (1777-1781), first independence (1918-1919), second independence(1991-1993). 


```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap = cap}
knitr::include_app("https://s1mona.shinyapps.io/lt_schools/", height="1000px")
cap <- 'Shiny app created via shinydashboard package. Live version can be found <a href="https://s1mona.shinyapps.io/lt_schools/">here</a>.'
```

Lithuanian flag was created with [RSelenium](http://ropensci.github.io/RSelenium), [imager](https://github.com/dahtah/imager) and [RsimMosaic](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RsimMosaic) from the front pages of schools websites.
