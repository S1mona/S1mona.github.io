Happy school year! With a lot of of help from Rselenium, I did some Wikipedia scrapping and gathered a data set on Lithuanian schools. The data does not cover the whole population, but it gives a rough overview of the situation. According to [the ministry of education](http://www.svis.smm.lt/) where were 1151 schools in 2016-2017. The data set covers about 80$\%$ of the total population. 


```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap = cap}
knitr::include_app("https://s1mona.shinyapps.io/lt_schools/", height="1000px")
cap <- 'Shiny app created via shinydashboard package. Live version can be found <a href="https://s1mona.shinyapps.io/lt_schools/">here</a>.'
```

One can see three major peaks: education reform (1777-1781), first independence (1918-1919), second independence(1991-1993). 

Note of caution: I did not exclude the schools that were closed. The numbers presented in the Shiny app correspond only to the number of newly founded schools. I have also excluded the schools that either do not provide information on the founding year, or do not have school webpage.
