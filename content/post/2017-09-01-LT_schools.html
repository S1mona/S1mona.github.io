<p>Happy school year! With a lot of of help from Rselenium I did some Wikipedia scrapping and gathered a data set on Lithuanian schools. According to <a href="http://www.svis.smm.lt/">the ministry of education</a> where were 1151 schools in 2016-2017. Data set covers about 80<span class="math inline">\(\%\)</span> of the total population. In this post only information that can be found on Wikipedia and schools websites which are given is presented. One can see three major peak periods: education reform (1777-1781), first independence (1918-1919), second independence(1991-1993).</p>
