      <description>Amazed by the election advertisements in Austria, I have decided to get my hands dirty and do some analyses about the forthcoming election. derStandard decided to have discussions why Austrians are electing FPÖ, Neos, and ÖVP.Strangely enough I did not find a discussion on SPÖ.
To get the postings I used wonderful RSelenium, for data cleaning tm, and for visualization wordcloud.
FPÖ - 1963 posts
Neos - 875 postings</description>

      <description>So today I have submitted my first article for review. We have calculated some interesting time indicators for Austria, such as value of leisure (VoL). Although, this work is partially done, it left me with a lot of questions. The used theoretical model takes into account only the official/paid work, but the domestic/unpaid work is not considered as a “real” work, as it does not generate any money.In our sample women work 8 hours less than men, but they are involved in 9 hours more of domestic work.</description>
