      <description>Happy school year! With a lot of of help from Rselenium, I did some Wikipedia scrapping and gathered a data set on Lithuanian schools. The data does not cover the whole population, but it gives a rough overview of the situation. According to the ministry of education where were 1151 schools in 2016-2017. The data set covers about 80\(\%\) of the total population.
