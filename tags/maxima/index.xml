      <description>During my bachelor studies I had to derive enormous amount of derivatives, integrals and limits. Being a huge fan of open-source programms, I began to look for something similar to Maple. That is how I found wxMaxima an open-source, easy to install and use program. For many years I did not use it, but recently I had to derive some expressions of conditional moments for multivariate normal distribution. Noway I was doing this by hand and I rememmbered the long forgotten Maxima.</description>
